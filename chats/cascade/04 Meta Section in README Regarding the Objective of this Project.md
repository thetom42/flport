Put a section on top of the README.md where you explain that this project is only for research and educational purposes with the objective to investigate how a developer works best with an AI Coding Agent like Windsurf.

I'll help you add a research and educational disclaimer section to the README.md file. First, let me check if the README.md exists and view its current content.

I'll now edit the README.md to add the research and educational disclaimer section at the top, before the project description.

I've added a clear disclaimer section at the top of the README.md file. The new section:

1. Has a distinct heading "Research and Educational Notice"
2. Clearly states the project's research and educational purpose
3. Specifically mentions the focus on AI Coding Agent collaboration with Windsurf
4. Is separated from the rest of the content with a horizontal rule (---)

The original content of the README remains unchanged below this new section. Is there anything else you'd like me to modify in the disclaimer section?
